This is by far the most trusted private service provider among India for broadband as well as coverage in GSM services owned by Bharti airtel. But their prices were high compared with the other operators in the market. I am having their broadband which is 4Mbps 1100 8gb shows that it was very costly though the claimed speeds are achieved and constant. If there is any fault in the network just register through the landline their representative will reach by next morning itself. so it is a reliable network for getting
Had applied for a broadband connection and the sales person assured me that within 2 days the connection would be provided. Regrettably after 15 days there is no update and now the customer care says that the "box has got choked", so NO internet connection.Now was the sales guy a goddamned retard ...
I have an Airtel Landline & Broadband connection(080-42012733). Multiple complaints has been raised from 25/April onwards. The last one was raised on 15/May. And the resolution time given for me is 21/May. Come on, an end user connectivity issue, which is linked to last mile connectivity and Airtel requires 7 days to resolve such an issue. Airtel, please, you should not be in this business, if this is the case.!
I was tried several broadband connections in my apartment. Now I am using airtel broadband connection. I am getting constant speed in my office and apartment.Anyway thank you Mr.Dinesh for introducing me airtel broadband
We switched to Verizon from AT&T and I was surprised to see how terrible it's been for the past 4 months. Calls dropping, terrible LTE connection, low signal, and supposedly it's the best network in America? More like worst. AT&T never gave us these problems and I wish I had never switched to this terrible network. Counting the days until my edge devices are paid off.
Verizon goes up on my bill every month with taxes and data usage. I'm ready to leave Verizon. We don't pay state tax but we have state tax on our bill. Verizon is really ripping people off!!! I been with them about 20 years and I'm starting to HATE this network.
Price is way Too Expensive!!! Verizon is the only service I can get at this time @ my house. But I'll be the first to hit the road as soon as more service open up in my location and it's coming soon... Ohhh how free I'll feel.
I have never seen such a PATHETIC customer care service in my life. Today(4th day) one of the technician called me saying we don't have building owners' permission(the building in which the DP box is there), If that is the case WHY AND HOW YOU HAVE GIVEN ME THE CONNECTION? As per my information he don't have any issues and secondly he will be not there for another 2 month is it means I will not get the connection for 2 month
I am using Airtel Broadband since 2007, the copper wires were laid in early 2000's and the worst part is that we are still accessing our internet thru those old copper wires only. I think Airtel is not interested in upgrading our Area to FTTH site. As a result we are not allowed to upgrade our broadband speed and connection automatically disconnected from ISP at every 15-20 mins intervals. I really want to convey this message to Airtel that please upgrade old copper wires with the new fiber optic so that we can also enjoy more speed(16mbps or more) and reliability. 
I am using Airtel broadband and landline for years and never had a big issue with it. Well nowadays I am facing a bit problems but those too not regularly. There are almost no problems in Airtel Broadband. And if you get a problem, they usually fix it the same day. No problem with Airtel.
I have been using Airtel broadband for last 10 yrs. now. The plans and speed provided by them is extremely consistent and value for money. What they promise is what you get. Some time back I shifted to BSNL but it was a total waste. Plans are extremely costly when compared to Airtel and the plans
